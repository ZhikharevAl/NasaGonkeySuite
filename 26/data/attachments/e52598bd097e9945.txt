In fact, near the cosmic heart's center are the massive hot stars of a newborn star cluster also known as Melotte 15, about 1.5 million years young. A little ironically, the Heart Nebula is located in the constellation Cassiopeia. From Greek mythology, the northern constellation is named for a vain and boastful queen.

In fact, the Red Eye Galaxy might also be an appropriate moniker in this colorful composition of narrow and wideband images. The enormous dust clouds obscuring the near-side of M64's central region are laced with the telltale reddish glow of hydrogen associated with star forming regions.  But they are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature. Observations show that M64 is actually composed of two concentric, counter-rotating systems. While all the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction as the interstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas in the outer regions, extending to about 40,000 light-years, rotates in the opposite direction. The dusty eye and bizarre rotation is likely the result of a billion year old merger of two different galaxies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1304/M64HaLRGB_Pugh.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M64: The Black Eye Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1304/M64HaLRGB_Pugh920.jpg"},{"date":"2022-06-19","explanation":"Can you create a planetary system that lasts for 1000 years? Super Planet Crash, the featured game, allows you to try.  To create up to ten planets, just click anywhere near the central star.  Planet types can be selected on the left in order of increasing mass: Earth, Super-Earth, Ice giant, Giant planet, Brown dwarf, or Dwarf star. Each planet is gravitationally attracted not only to the central Sun-like star, but to other planets. Points are awarded, with bonus factors applied for increasingly crowded and habitable systems. The game ends after 1000 years or when a planet is gravitationally expelled. Many exoplanetary systems are being discovered in recent years, and Super Planet Crash demonstrates why some remain stable.  As you might suspect after playing Super Planet Crash a few times, there is reason to believe that our own Solar System has lost planets during its formation.","media_type":"video","service_version":"v1","title":"Game: Super Planet Crash","url":"https://stefanom.org/spc/game.php"},{"date":"1998-11-04","explanation":"At the Nature of the Universe Debate held last month at the Smithsonian, top cosmologists P.

Peebles, watching, was more cautious, agreeing that the evidence for a big bang is strong, but arguing that the specific type is still unclear.  Peebles noted that a big bang leaving little but low-density matter still could not be ruled out.  Both Turner and Peebles agreed that this is an exciting time, as data should continue to pour in and curious astrophysicists scramble to decode the geometry of the universe.   Margaret J.

Images of the star forming region W5 like those in the infrared by NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite provide clear clues with indications that massive stars near the center of empty cavities are older than stars near the edges.  A likely reason for this is that the older stars in the center are actually triggering the formation of the younger edge stars.  The triggered star formation occurs when hot outflowing gas compresses cooler gas into knots dense enough to gravitationally contract into stars.  In the featured scientifically-colored infrared image, spectacular pillars, left slowly evaporating from the hot outflowing gas, provide further visual clues. W5 is also known as IC 1848, and together with IC 1805 form a complex region of star formation popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulas.

Something is happening in a small portion of the sky toward the constellation of Aries. Telescopes around the globe are tracking an unusual transient there as it changes day by day.

Dubbed GRB 060218, the object is a type of gamma ray burst (GRB) but the way its brightness changes is very unusual.  Since detection, GRB 060218 has been found to emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves and visible light.

The fireball is thought to have been caused by a car-sized chunk of ice and rock crashing into the Earth's atmosphere. Since the event was captured from so many angles, the meteor's trajectory has become determined well enough to indicate from where it came and to where any resultant pieces might have landed. It is already certain that this meteor had nothing to do with the several-times larger asteroid 2012 DA14 which passed the Earth from a different direction later the same day.  If pieces of the meteor are found, they might tell humanity more about the early Solar System, when the meteor was likely formed.

The new answer to this old question is the Canis Major dwarf galaxy.

Recent measurements indicate that the Canis Major dwarf is only 42,000 light years from the Galactic center, about three quarters of the distance to the Sagittarius dwarf and a quarter of the distance to the LMC.  The discovery was made in data from the 2MASS-sky survey, where infrared light allows a better view through our optically opaque Galactic plane.

There, since the Moon is too far from the Earth to block the entire Sun, sunlight streamed around the edges of the Moon creating a \"ring of fire\". At some times, though, the effect was a rare type of annular eclipse. Then, an edge of the Moon nearly aligned with an edge of the Sun, allowing sunlight to stream through only low areas on the Moon.
