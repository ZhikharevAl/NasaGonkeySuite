At the peak of this eclipse, the middle of the Sun will appear to be missing and the dark Moon will appear to be surrounded by the bright Sun.  This will only be visible, however, from a path that crosses the southern Indian Ocean.  From more populated locations, southern Africa and parts of Australia, most of the Moon will only appear to take a bite out the Sun.  Remember to never look directly at the Sun even during an eclipse.  An annular eclipse occurs instead of a total eclipse when the Moon is on the far part of its elliptical orbit around the Earth.  The next annular eclipse of the Sun will take place in 2010 January, although a total solar eclipse will occur this July.

Just as the comet swooped inside the orbit of Mercury and developed a long and flowing tail of gas and dust, the Sun emitted a huge Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).  Neither the fortuitous hot ball of solar gas nor the intense glare of sunlight appeared to disrupt the comet's nucleus.  The action was too close to the Sun to be easily visible by humans, but the orbiting Sun-pointing SOHO satellite had a clear view of the celestial daredevil show.  The above image was taken on February 18 when the comet was so bright it created an artificial horizontal streak on the camera image.  During the encounter, Comet NEAT, official designation (C/2002 V1), brightened to second magnitude.  An opaque disk blocked the Sun's image.  The now-outbound comet remains bright but will surely fade as it moves away from the Sun.   Nevertheless, Comet NEAT will likely be visible with binoculars to southern hemisphere observers for the next month.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/neatcme_soho_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comet Neat Passes an Erupting Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/neatcme_soho.jpg"},{"copyright":"\nNoel Carboni\n","date":"2006-09-07","explanation":"No single exposure can easily capture faint stars along with the subtle colors of the Moon.

The rim of the blue galaxy pictured on the right is an immense ring-like structure 150,000 light years in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, massive stars.  That galaxy, AM 0644-741, is known as a ring galaxy and was caused by an immense galaxy collision.  When galaxies collide, they pass through each other -- their individual stars rarely come into contact.  The ring-like shape is the result of the gravitational disruption caused by an entire small intruder galaxy passing through a large one.  When this happens, interstellar gas and dust become condensed, causing a wave of star formation to move out from the impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.  The likely intruder galaxy is on the left of this combined image from Hubble (visible) and Chandra (X-ray) space telescopes.  X-ray light is shown in pink and depicts places where energetic black holes or neutron stars, likely formed shortly after the galaxy collision, reside.

In fact, 21st century astronomers would identify it as a planetary nebula, but it's not a planet either, even though it may appear round and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a sun-like star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star's intense but invisible ultraviolet light.

First, in the foreground, is Crater Lake -- a caldera created by volcanism on planet Earth about 7,700 years ago. Next, inside the lake, is water.  Although the origin of the water in the crater is melted snowfall, the origin of water on Earth more generally is unclear, but possibly related to ancient Earthly-impacts of icy bodies. Next, the green glow in the sky is airglow, light emitted by atoms high in the Earth's atmosphere as they recombine at night after being separated during the day by energetic sunlight. The many points of light in the sky are stars, glowing by nuclear fusion.  They are far above the atmosphere but nearby to our Sun in the Milky Way Galaxy. Finally, the bright arch across the image is the central band of the Milky Way, much further away, on the average, than the nearby stars, and shaped mostly by gravity.

To do this Brahe and his assistants created the first major astronomical observatory where they devised and used the most accurate pre-telescopic astronomical instruments.  Tycho Brahe thus compiled tables of precise measurements of the positions and brightnesses of planets and stars.  Brahe never solved the Solar System problem himself - but left data so impressively accurate his assistant Johannes Kepler was able to develop definitive laws.

Today, evidence is accumulating that most of the energy density in the universe is in an unknown form dubbed dark energy.  The form and genesis of dark energy is almost completely unknown, but postulated as related to vacuum fluctuations similar to the Casimir Effect but generated somehow by space itself.

Even close to its dense core at the left, the cluster's aging red and blue giant stars and rejuvenated blue stragglers stand out in yellow and blue hues in the sharp color image.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1404/m5hst2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hubble's Messier 5","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1404/m5hst950.jpg"},{"date":"2012-12-11","explanation":"Stars are sometimes born in the midst of chaos.  About 3 million years ago in the nearby galaxy M33, a large cloud of gas spawned dense internal knots which gravitationally collapsed to form stars.  NGC 604 was so large, however, it could form enough stars to make a globular cluster.  Many young stars from this cloud are visible in the above image from the Hubble Space Telescope, along with what is left of the initial gas cloud.  Some stars were so massive they have already evolved and exploded in a supernova.  The brightest stars that are left emit light so energetic that they create one of the largest clouds of ionized hydrogen gas known, comparable to the Tarantula Nebula in our Milky Way's close neighbor, the Large Magellanic Cloud.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1212/ngc604_hstlegacy_1512.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 604: Giant Stellar Nursery","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1212/ngc604_hstlegacy_960.jpg"},{"copyright":"\nVictor Lima\n","date":"2022-11-29","explanation":"Because the Gum Nebula is the closest supernova remnant, it is actually hard to see.

Also visible in the frame are the Atacama Desert in Chile in the foreground, the Carina Nebula in the plane of our Milky Way galaxy running diagonally down from the upper left, and the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy. The Gum Nebula is so close that we are much nearer the front edge than the back edge, each measuring 450 and 1500 light years respectively.

The answer depends on the type of light considered, and for some wavelengths, all the cluttering material in the foreground makes it still unknown.  Recently, however, the background in near infrared light was imaged at high resolution by the 2MASS telescope, and confirmed earlier estimates that it is over twice as bright as originally expected.  A small section of Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) is shown above in representative colors.  Visible is light emitted from the very first stars and galaxies in the universe, emitted when the universe was less than half its current age.  The CIB is more uniform than the present universe since stars were more spread out at early times.

In fact, groups of galaxies like HCGs may be the building blocks of the large clusters. This false-color x-ray image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory reveals x-ray emission from the gas in one such group, HCG 62, in startling detail.

No one is yet sure, but it may have to do with the dynamics of an asteroid that is a loose  pile of rubble rather than a solid rock.  The unusual asteroid has been visited recently by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa that has been documenting its unusual structure and mysterious lack of craters.  Recent analyses of the border regions between smooth and rugged sections of Itokawa indicate that jostling of the asteroid might be creating segregation between large and small rocks near the surface, like the Brazil nut effect. In late 2005, Hayabusa actually touched down on one of the smooth patches, dubbed the MUSES Sea, and collected soil samples that are to be returned to Earth for analysis. Hayabusa will start its three-year long return trip to Earth this month.

Recent images from the robotic MESSENGER spacecraft that flew by Mercury last October show previously uncharted regions of Mercury that have large craters with an internal smoothness similar to the maria on Earth's own Moon. Therefore, like our Moon's maria, these craters on Mercury are thought to have been flooded by lava floes that are old but not as old as the surrounding more highly cratered surface. The above image mosaic of the western limb of Mercury was created by MESSENGER as it approached the Solar System's innermost planet last October.  Old and heavily textured terrain runs across much of the image bottom, while across the middle left lies comparatively smooth impact basins where small craters may appear similar at first to protruding hills.

Vast sections of this strange world are dark as coal, while others are as bright as ice.  The composition of the dark material is unknown, but infrared spectra indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of carbon.  Iapetus also has an unusual equatorial ridge that makes it appear like a walnut.  To help better understand this seemingly painted moon, NASA directed the robotic Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to swoop within 2,000 kilometers in 2007. Pictured above, from about 75,000 kilometers out, Cassini's trajectory allowed unprecedented imaging of the hemisphere of Iapetus that is always trailing.  A huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers and appears superposed on an older crater of similar size. The dark material is seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of Iapetus, darkening craters and highlands alike.  Close inspection indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick. A leading hypothesis is that the dark material is mostly dirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice sublimates. An initial coating of dark material may have been effectively painted on by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons. This and other images from Cassini's Iapetus flyby are being studied for even greater clues.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0908/iapetus3_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn's Iapetus: Painted Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0908/iapetus3_cassini.jpg"},{"copyright":"Babak Tafreshi","date":"2015-11-12","explanation":"On November 8, a waning crescent Moon joined the continuing parade of planets in Earth's early morning skies.

As if Moon and planets aren't enough, a comparably bright Taurid meteor also streaks through the scene. In fact November's Taurid meteor showers have had a high proportion of bright fireballs.

The eclipsed Moon is red because the Earth's umbral shadow is suffused with a faint red light. The ruddy illumination is from all the reddened sunsets and sunrises, as seen from a lunar perspective.
