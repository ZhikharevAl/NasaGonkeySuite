The notable absence of impact craters suggests that the entire surface is covered with new volcanic deposits much more rapidly than craters are created. What drives this volcanic powerhouse? A likely energy source is the changing gravitational tides caused by Jupiter and the other Galilean moons as Io orbits the massive gas giant planet.

Fortunately, this is not meant to be the first step in a Galactic war.  Rather, astronomers at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) site in Chile are trying to measure the distortions of Earth's ever changing atmosphere.  Constant imaging of high-altitude atoms excited by the laser -- which appear like an artificial star -- allow astronomers to instantly measure atmospheric blurring.  This information is fed back to a VLT telescope mirror which is then slightly deformed to minimize this blurring.  In this case, a VLT was observing our Galaxy's center, and so Earth's atmospheric blurring in that direction was needed.  As for inter-galaxy warfare, when viewed from our Galaxy's center, no casualties are expected.  In fact, the light from this powerful laser would combine with light from our Sun to together appear only as bright as a faint and distant star.

Lightning usually takes a jagged course, rapidly heating a thin column of air to about three times the surface temperature of the Sun.  The resulting shock wave starts supersonically and decays into the loud sound known as thunder.

Its haunting symmetries are seen in the very central region of this stunning false-color picture, processed to reveal the enormous but extremely faint halo of gaseous material, over three light-years across, which surrounds the brighter, familiar planetary nebula. Made with data from the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, the composite picture shows extended emission from the nebula. Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star. Only much more recently however, have some planetaries been found to have halos like this one, likely formed of material shrugged off during earlier active episodes in the star's evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of this halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2006/catseye2_not_2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Halo of the Cat's Eye","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2006/catseye2_not_960.jpg"},{"date":"2009-12-11","explanation":"Many bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth's sky are associated with the name of astronomer Charles Messier, from his famous 18th century catalog. His name is also given to these two large and remarkable craters on the Moon. Standouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8 and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively. Their elongated shapes are explained by an extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by the impactor, moving left to right, that gouged out the craters. The shallow impact also resulted in two bright rays of material extending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture. Intended to be viewed with red/blue glasses (red for the left eye), this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created from high resolution scans of two images (AS11-42-6304, AS11-42-6305) taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0912/MessierCrater3d_vantuyne.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Messier Craters in Stereo","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0912/MessierCrater3d_vantuyneC900.jpg"},{"copyright":"Mike Killian","date":"2014-01-30","explanation":"Fixed to a tripod and looking east across the Kennedy Space Center's Turn Basin, a camera captured these star trails as a series of short exposures over a three hour period on the evening of January 23rd. Positioned just a few miles from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, it also captured a spectacular night launch of an Atlas V rocket carrying NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite TDRS-L. Creating the trails, the apparent motion of the stars through the sky is just a reflection of the daily rotation of planet Earth on its axis. But that rotation is also the reason the rocket streak follows a path arcing east across the Atlantic. Launching toward the east, in the direction of Earth's rotation, adds the rotation velocity to the rocket and reduces the fuel needed to reach orbit. A little ironically, TDRS-L is destined for a geostationary orbit. From there, 36,000 kilometers or so above the equator, its orbital period will match Earth's rotation and the satellite will hang motionless in planet Earth's sky.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1401/RocketStarTrailsKillian.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rocket Streak and Star Trails","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1401/RocketStarTrailsKillian950.jpg"},{"date":"2016-06-11","explanation":"Named for the southern constellation toward which most of its galaxies can be found, the Fornax Cluster is one of the closest clusters of galaxies.

The sources of many of these background radiations have remained long-standing puzzles, but this millennial year brought some partial resolutions.  In X-ray light the recently launched spacecraft Chandra and XMM resolved much of the seemingly uniform X-ray background into many discrete sources, many of which appear to be black holes at the centers of galaxies accreting matter.  In microwave light, the BOOMERANG and MAXIMA-1 missions resolved with new clarity the seemingly uniform microwave background.  The size and distribution of these spots indicates a geometrically flat universe, which, when combined recent supernovae results, indicate a universe with an accelerating expansion rate filled with dark matter and dark energy.

However, in the 2006 passage, it disintegrated into dozens of fragments that stretched several degrees across the sky. Since comets are relatively fragile, stresses from heat, gravity and outgassing, for example, could be responsible for their tendency to break up in such a spectacular fashion when they near the hot Sun. The Hubble Space Telescope recorded, in 2006, the featured sharp view of prolific Fragment B, itself trailing a multitude of smaller pieces, each with its own cometary coma and tail.

Astronomers turn detectives when trying to figure out the cause of unusual jumbles of stars, gas, and dust like NGC 1316.   A preliminary inspection indicates that NGC 1316 is an enormous elliptical galaxy that includes dark dust lanes usually found in a spiral.  The above image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows details, however, that help in reconstructing the history of this gigantic jumble.  Close inspection finds fewer low mass globular clusters of stars toward NGC 1316's center. Such an effect is expected in galaxies that have undergone collisions or merging with other galaxies in the past few billion years.  After such collisions, many star clusters would be destroyed in the dense galactic center.  The dark knots and lanes of dust indicate that one or more of the devoured galaxies were spiral galaxies.  NGC 1316 spans about 60,000 light years and lies about 75 million light years away toward the constellation of the Furnace.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/ngc1316_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 1316: After Galaxies Collide","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/ngc1316_hst.jpg"},{"copyright":"\nOle C.

Today. Today is an equinox on planet Earth, a time of year when day and night are most nearly equal. At an equinox, the Earth's terminator -- the dividing line between day and night -- becomes vertical and connects the north and south poles. The featured time-lapse video demonstrates this by displaying an entire year on planet Earth in twelve seconds. From geosynchronous orbit, the Meteosat 9 satellite recorded these infrared images of the Earth every day at the same local time.  The video started at the September 2010 equinox with the terminator line being vertical. As the Earth revolved around the Sun, the terminator was seen to tilt in a way that provides less daily sunlight to the northern hemisphere, causing winter in the north. As the year progressed, the March 2011 equinox arrived halfway through the video, followed by the terminator tilting the other way, causing winter in the southern hemisphere -- and summer in the north.
